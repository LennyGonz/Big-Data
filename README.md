# Big-Data
<hr>

The files in this repo are associated with my Big Data class taught by Professor Huy Vo.

We learned how to use Spark, and practiced python's functional capabilities.

The yelp factbook was our final project, where my team and I exercised as many concepts that we learned to extract cool and interesting facts.
We made a simple HTML page to demonstrate all the facts we discovered.
